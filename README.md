# CSCI-2530
Algorithms and Data Structures coursework

Language: C/C++

Description:
This course was the first course to introduce C++ to introductory ECU Computer Science students. This course highlighted introductory data structures like lists, stacks, queues, heaps along with algorithms to go along with these data structures.

Disclaimer:
This repository was created to highlight coursework that Michael Trinh has done for Algorithms and Data Structures. I am refreshing myself on the course's core concepts to relearn important fundamentals and to prepare for interview questions. The code of this repository is not provided to encourage academic plaigarism but only to highlight the review of data structures and algorithms. Michael Trinh is not responsible for any academic penalties that may occur via plaigarising this repository's code.
